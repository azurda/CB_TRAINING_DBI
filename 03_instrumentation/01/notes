Firstly we are going to introduce FRIDA using practical samples.

We have a function that basically just loops through an infinite loop and prints 
the given argument. 

This serves as an example of how we can use FRIDA at a basic level.

We use python as a means of interacting with frida, however it's possible to use different
language bindings such as java, swift...

We also use javascript in order to access the FRIDA features that we have seen
in the API. 

We will them, always have two parts a JS script and bindings to intereact with frida runtime.


In this script, we use the function pointer which is known, and then we try
to read the first argument.
